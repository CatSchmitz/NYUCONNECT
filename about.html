				<p class="about_page_description">

				The NYU Connect Digital Literacy Summer program is sponsored by NYU&#8217;s Steinhardt School, in partnership with The Metropolitan Center for Research on Equity, and led by Dr. Charlton McIlwain, professor of Media, Culture, and Communication at NYU.
 				<br><br>
				We will be hosting 30 High School Juniors and Seniors from Fannie Lou Hamer High School in the Bronx. This is an on campus initiative that consists of both morning and afternoon components where we introduce students to the basics of design and web development, as well as traditional literacies such as argumentation, essay writing, critical thinking, etc.</p>

				<p class="about_page_description">
				Megan Rim recently received her MA from the department Media, Culture, and Communications at NYU Steinhardt. Her undergraduate degree was from the University of Illinois - Urbana Champaign in Comparative Literature. She spends a lot of her time watching TV and wondering how mainstream media can be co-opted for social and racial justice work. She loves science fiction/fantasy, dogs, some cats, yoga, and sleeping. She has one dog named JJ (Joan Jett) who also likes to sleep. She is originally from Chicago, home of the BEST pizzas AND BEST hotdogs (indisputably), and likes to pretend that she is immune to New York weather. She’s always down to chat about TV, especially if anyone has a credible theory about Jon Snow.

				<h4 class="name_heading">Ben </h4> 

				<p class="about_page_description">
Ben Vien hails from North Carolina where he learned to appreciate, among many things from the simpler life, the great outdoors.  Seeking a break from all that fresh air, he now acts as the Associate Director for Technology Services at the NYU Steinhardt School of Culture, Education, and Human Development.  He lives for organizational efficiency and comes alive when given the opportunity to identify and optimize bottlenecks in technology systems and business structures.  When that gets boring, Ben enjoys a game on XBOX ONE (you know, the real console), or hangs out down on the Hudson for a nice sunset dinner.
