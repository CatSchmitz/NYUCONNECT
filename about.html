				The NYU Connect Digital Literacy Summer program is sponsored by NYU&#8217;s Steinhardt School, in partnership with The Metropolitan Center for Research on Equity, and led by Dr. Charlton McIlwain, professor of Media, Culture, and Communication at NYU.
 				<br><br>
				We will be hosting 30 High School Juniors and Seniors from Fannie Lou Hamer High School in the Bronx. This is an on campus initiative that consists of both morning and afternoon components where we introduce students to the basics of design and web development, as well as traditional literacies such as argumentation, essay writing, critical thinking, etc.</p>

				I choose a picture of a clock because I finally understand that being on time and meeting deadlines is everything in life. This year in school I always used to class to school exactly as it started, but I learned that doing that is almost like being late. I now know that coming early is better than being late and time is very important.

Hi, my name is Crystal, I am in the 11th grade and I go to Fannie Lou Hamer Freedom High School in the Bronx.

What I plan to do after college is opening my own cultural restaurant with a variety of different foods and other small businesses. This picture explains what I want to do when I get older because while you may see a birthday cake to me there is a much deeper meaning. Looking back on my 16th birthday I had such good memories and singing happy birthday is common for most people and I want to create the best cakes and also food cuisines for people to remember to remember that special moment.

Photography and art in general is just something that I love. I feel like everything digital has a connection and hopefully I can learn a little more about everything in this class. The photo I chose to represent myself was just to show that I am turning over a new leaf, I am exiting the smoke and leaving all the bad behind. Not smoke as in cigarettes but smoke as in something horrible to exhale that just kills you inside which I think everything that holds you back is just like smoke. It slows you down whether it be fake friendships or a bad habit that you have or failure to thrive it is killing you slowly and pulling you down into it and it is up to you to either fight it and try to get through it for yourself. My main goal throughout life has been and always be to stay a positive person and to not get sucked into all the negativity that may be around me.

				<p class="about_page_description">
Marcha is a rising junior in NYU MCC program. When she is not spreading the good word of code, she os usually trying to convince people why their next family vacation should be a trip to her home country, Trinidad. 
Apart from school, she is also a writer, covering all things dancehall and soca related. Not to mention, SoundCloud is her music streaming service of choice and strongly believes the TUMBLR user community can lead a revolution. Marcha is super psyched to be joining the NYU-Connect/EXCEL  this summer and can not wait to meet all of you.
Peace.

				<p class="about_page_description">
				Megan Rim recently received her MA from the department Media, Culture, and Communications at NYU Steinhardt. Her undergraduate degree was from the University of Illinois - Urbana Champaign in Comparative Literature. She spends a lot of her time watching TV and wondering how mainstream media can be co-opted for social and racial justice work. She loves science fiction/fantasy, dogs, some cats, yoga, and sleeping. She has one dog named JJ (Joan Jett) who also likes to sleep. She is originally from Chicago, home of the BEST pizzas AND BEST hotdogs (indisputably), and likes to pretend that she is immune to New York weather. She is always down to chat about TV, especially if anyone has a credible theory about Jon Snow.

				<p class="about_page_description">
Ben Vien hails from North Carolina where he learned to appreciate, among many things from the simpler life, the great outdoors.  Seeking a break from all that fresh air, he now acts as the Associate Director for Technology Services at the NYU Steinhardt School of Culture, Education, and Human Development.  He lives for organizational efficiency and comes alive when given the opportunity to identify and optimize bottlenecks in technology systems and business structures.  When that gets boring, Ben enjoys a game on XBOX ONE (you know, the real console), or hangs out down on the Hudson for a nice sunset dinner.
